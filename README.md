This repository contains Tableau workbooks and supporting datasets for Data Visualization coursework.

Contents
- `code/`: Tableau workbook files (.twb, .twbr) for lab exercises and experiments.
- `DATASETS/`: CSV datasets used by the workbooks (organized into experiment subfolders).
- `images/`: Visual assets used in reports or slides.
- `prateek_lab_steps/`: Lab step notes and resources.

Quick usage
- Open files in `code/` or the `end eam prep/` folder with Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public (where supported).
- Use CSVs from `DATASETS/` when recreating analyses or building new visualizations.

If you want, I can add a detailed README with dataset descriptions, sample commands, or a usage guide.
